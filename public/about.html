<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>As a passionate web developer, I also happen to have a soft spot for coffee. My journey into the world of digital marketing began when I enrolled in a prestigious institute to learn about the subject. From there, I secured an internship at Lejhro Company as a Social Media Manager, where I gained invaluable practical experience. Subsequently, I joined Digiview Marketing Services as an SEO analyst, where I further developed my skills in the field. Currently, I am expanding my expertise by undertaking courses in Full Stack Web Development and Wordpress Web Development. I am enthusiastic about the endless possibilities that lie ahead as I continue to learn and grow in this ever-evolving industry.</p>
